    MSS - Mission Support System

    http://www.geosci-model-dev.net/5/55/2012/gmd-5-55-2012.pdf

    Software for planning research Aircraft Missions.
    For discussion of the possibilites of the research flights,
    the Mission Support System (MSS) was developed.
    This software helps to review a big amount of metereological and
    model data by viewing the forecasted parameters of interest along possible regions
    of a proposed flight path. Data and possible flight paths can
    be displayed on a hoizontal view (map projection) or on a vertical
    view (along the proposed flight path). Flight paths can be constructed
    and modified on these views. Exchange through a waypoint table is also possible.
