Installation notes Mission Support System Client under Windows
==============================================================

(March 2014, mr)


1) Install Python.
==================
Execute the "python-2.7.x..." installer from the archive OR
download from http://python.org/downloads/windows/

Install Python to C:\MSS\Python27 (or any folder of your choice, below
we assume this path).

If you are asked to restart, restart now.

NOTE: The MSS currently only works with Python 2.X, not 3.X!


2) Install Python packages.
===========================

Install the following packages to to C:\MSS\Python27\... (or your path):

If you need to download them, go to http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/
(the basemap download might not work; in this case use the package provided
by matplotlib: http://sourceforge.net/projects/matplotlib/files/matplotlib-toolkits/)

numpy
scipy
matplotlib
basemap
pyqt
pillow
pip
setuptools
dateutil
pyparsing
six


3) Modify the System "PATH" and "PYTHONPATH" environment variables:
===================================================================

(I only have a German Windows 8 installation available, hence the German
labels in the following lines) -- under Windows 8:

System control -> System and security -> System
(Systemsteuerung -> System und Sicherheit -> System)

On the left, click on
"Erweiterte Systemeinstellungen"

Click on
"Umgebungsvariablen"

In "Systemvariablen", modify the "Path" variable and add 

C:\MSS\Python27;C:\MSS\Python27\Scripts;

to its beginning.

Add a new variable "PYTHONPATH" and set it to

C:\MSS;C:\MSS\thirdparty


4) Install geopy package.
=========================

Open the command line (Eingabeaufforderung).

Change the current directory to "C:\MSS"

Enter the following command:

C:\MSS> pip install geopy


5) Install MSS sources.
=======================

Either checkout the current MSS sources from the MSS repository
at https://bitbucket.org/wxmetvis/mss/, or,

alternatively, copy the contents of the zip file containing the MSS 
sources to a new subfolder in C:\MSS.

Go to the msui folder and rename all files ending with ".sample"
to their corresponding names without ".sample"
(e.g. mss_settings.py.sample to mss_settings.py)

Edit mss_settings.py: Find the line "wms_cache = ..."  
Comment the line with "os.environ["HOME"], this only works under
Linux. Use the line "wms_cache = "./wms_cache"

If you like, create a link from mss_pyui.py to your
desktop. Alternatively, start the program from the command line by
executing "python mss_pyui.py" in the C:\MSS\<your folder>\msui" directory.


Appendix) Known bugs:
=====================

-- top/side views appear black when they are opened: simply resize the window
-- no contour lines in cylindric projections
